# Week 2 Status Report

## Team Report

1. N/A
2. We mostly worked on the policies and requirements. Moreover, we learned each team member's skills and different available software tool sets that we can use to build our project. With that, we assigned each member a role and decided on the toolset that we will use. So far, we have not encountered any trouble, nor got stuck anywhere.
3. Our plan is to have the REST API specified and a repository is set up on Github first. Then, the frontend group will start working on building the calendar view, and the backend group will start creating a database and querying.

#### Agenda for project meeting with TA:
Feedback for software tool sets we decided and our tentative schedule



## Contributions of individual team members

#### Cat:
1. N/A
2. I participated in group meetings, wrote a use case, and contributed toward finishing the requirements documents. I was not stuck anywhere, nor encountered any trouble.
3. In the following week, I will participate in team meetings to have the REST API specified and work on building the calendar view.

#### Jacob:
1. N/A
2. I worked with the group on the policy document, specifically helping with technology selection and coming up with a schedule. This involved some research and I learned about various databases and frameworks for building web apps. We had some difficulty finding a suitable toolset that we had enough experience with; with both the frontend and backend most of us will need to learn new frameworks. Otherwise I think we have a reasonable timeline for completing the project.
3. Tomorrow I'm hoping to have the REST API finalized, after that I'll be working on setting up React Native and starting work on the frontend

#### James:
1. N/A
2. I participated in the group meetings and identified that my role in the group would be focusing on database design and implementation. I also reviewed class material from the database course and began initial planning for what the SQL tables might look like. I felt that the group did a good job communicating roles and responsibilities with each other. I learned it was possible to identify potential edge cases before the implementation and testing phases by identifying and articulating use cases. 
3. Next week I will continue to participate in group meetings and contribute toward the REST API specification, as well as work to design the SQL tables necessary for the app. 

#### Marlena:
1. N/A
2. I attended the group meetings, both in section and on zoom, and participated in group discussions regarding project planning and requirements assignment logistics. I worked on the requirements assignment document. I found that individual work coupled with meeting on zoom to talk about the work and do some collaborative work was an effective strategy. I learned about use cases in class and through writing them, and I learned from my teammates after asking them some questions about the details of frontend vs backend work. I had trouble deciding whether Iâ€™d be most helpful on the frontend or backend group because I am relatively inexperienced in both.
3. In the coming week I will contribute to the team building of the API and I will work on the Git setup assignment. I will also start work on the database creation/queries with the backend group.

#### Thompson:
1. N/A
2. I attended the team meetings and collaborated with the team on the project requirements (which included individually writing a use case). I learned about the skillsets of each of my team members along with the options we had for the tools we could use for our project. I am not currently stuck or having any trouble.
3. For next week I will work with the team to work on the REST API and start working on creating databases/queries with the backend team.

#### Vasudev:
1. N/A 
2. Unfortunately due to some family health conflicts I was unable to attend in person for the last few days. However, I have thoroughly read through our living document as well as doing in depth research on Ruby, the framework we're using for the backend. Additionally, I spent some time refreshing my memory on SQL.
3. For the next week I will work with the team to start figuring out our database framework and how to tie it in to the web application.
