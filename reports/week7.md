- **frontend:** Our plan to implement the REST api call to communicate with the backend, and work toward improving the auto scheduling algorithm.
- **backend:** Finish foreign keys and implement user authentication.

2. 
Both groups worked on the Implmementation and Documentation.
- **frontend**: We worked on implementing the fetch REST api request to communicate with the backend.
- **backend**: Worked on user authentication and testing
We did not encounter any troubles nor getting stuck at any places.

## Contributions of individual team members


#### Cat:
1. My plan is to work with Jacob to implement the REST api call to communicate with the backend and collaborate with group to work on the Implementation and Documentation assignment.
2. I implemented the REST api call in the frontend to communicate with the backend, and I also worked on the developer guidelines for the frontend. 
3. My plan is to work with Jacob to finish some minor stuffs in the REST api call and work with the backend team to test the application.


#### Jacob:
1. This week I want to clean up some of the code I wrote, since I was working very quickly to get the demo working, as well as connect the app's internal model with the REST API so it can work with the backend. There are also some features I didn't get around to implementing, like repeated events and navigating between calendar weeks, that I would like to finish.
2. I worked with Cat on adding REST API calls to the app, to synchronize its internal state with the backend. I got the backend running on my laptop so I could test the connection. I also worked on debugging some issues with the UI widget library we're using, and writing user documentation.
3. This week I would like to work on the auto-scheduling algorithm, together with some members of the backend team.

#### Marlena:
1. I will help implement more backend features and add on to the tests we have.
2. I worked in the task controller and constraint controller and tests for these controllers.
3. The setup for the controllers ended up changing, so I'll work to re-configure testing for the controllers.
