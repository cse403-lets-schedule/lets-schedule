# Week 7 Status Report

## Team Report

1. 
- **frontend:** Our plan to implement the REST api call to communicate with the backend, and work toward improving the auto scheduling algorithm.
- **backend:** Finish foreign keys and implement user authentication.

2. 
Both groups worked on the Implmementation and Documentation.
- **frontend**: We worked on implementing the fetch REST api request to communicate with the backend.
- **backend**: Worked on user authentication and testing
We did not encounter any troubles nor getting stuck at any places.

3. 
- **frontend:** Our plan is to work with the backend to test the application and fixing bugs.
- **backend:** We will implement tests and refine backend code as needed.

## Contributions of individual team members


#### Cat:
1. My plan is to work with Jacob to implement the REST api call to communicate with the backend and collaborate with group to work on the Implementation and Documentation assignment.
2. I implemented the REST api call in the frontend to communicate with the backend, and I also worked on the developer guidelines for the frontend. 
3. My plan is to work with Jacob to finish some minor stuffs in the REST api call and work with the backend team to test the application.


#### Jacob:
1. This week I want to clean up some of the code I wrote, since I was working very quickly to get the demo working, as well as connect the app's internal model with the REST API so it can work with the backend. There are also some features I didn't get around to implementing, like repeated events and navigating between calendar weeks, that I would like to finish.
2. I worked with Cat on adding REST API calls to the app, to synchronize its internal state with the backend. I got the backend running on my laptop so I could test the connection. I also worked on debugging some issues with the UI widget library we're using, and writing user documentation.
3. This week I would like to work on the auto-scheduling algorithm, together with some members of the backend team.


#### James:
1. 
 It is really important that we implement some sort of user authentication in
   the next week, as all of the querying for tasks and events depends on an
   authorized user having access to only their content (even though everything
   is stored in the one server and database). This task seems difficult to
   implement so I'm going to put a lot of attention toward getting it done this
   week. Hopefully we can get some testing implemented at the same time. I am
   also going to work to make sure everyone in the backend team is aware of
2. 
I did successfully implement the user authentication functionality of the code. 
In order to do so,  I had to completely regenerate the project so that it fit a
rails api framework, as well as that of an external tool called devise-api.
Aftwards I succesfully implemented routes and controllers so that they worked
under this new system of authenticating users so that they only have access to
their own data. 
3. 
This next week I'm going to work with the rest of the back end folks to finish
the controller code implementation, as well as make sure things are robustly
tested. I am also going to collaborate with the front end to make sure that
interfacing with the front end is possible.  


#### Marlena:
1. I will help implement more backend features and add on to the tests we have.
2. I worked in the task controller and constraint controller and tests for these controllers.
3. The setup for the controllers ended up changing, so I'll work to re-configure testing for the controllers.

#### Thompson:
1. I will help implement anything else that still has yet to be implemented for the backend.
2. I helped with the Implementation & Documentation and I started writing some tests.
3. I will continue writing tests and implementing any other necessary features.
