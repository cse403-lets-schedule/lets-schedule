# Week 3 Status Report

## Team Report

1. Our plan is to have the REST API specified and a repository is set up on Github first. Then, the frontend group will start working on building the calendar view, and the backend group will start creating a database and querying.
2. Our group finished setting up a repository on Github, and the specification for the REST API is also almost finished. We just started the implementation of the calendar application this week. We learned that we are a little bit behind the schedule due to the delay in setting up the repository. This means that we might not be able to finish the calendar view and database creation by 1/26 according to our planned schedule.
3. Our plan is to have the frontend group finish implementing the calendar view and the backend group finish the creation of the database and queries as soon as possible. Then, we can continue building the auto scheduling algorithm with the plan to finish it at about 70%.

#### Agenda for project meeting with TA:
Feedback on the architecture model and Github repository



## Contributions of individual team members

#### Cat:
1. In the following week, I will participate in team meetings to have the REST API specified and work on building the calendar view.
2. I collaborated with team members to have the REST API specified and the repository is set up. There is little delay in starting the implementation of the calendar, but everything should be on track.
3. I will start to figure out how the React Native framework works and collaborate with Jacob to work on the calendar view with the goal to finish it early in order to get started on the auto scheduling algorithm.

#### Jacob:
1. Tomorrow I'm hoping to have the REST API finalized, after that I'll be working on setting up React Native and starting work on the frontend
2. I worked with the rest of the team to write up the REST API. As I was hoping this forced us to consider the specifics of our design, exactly what information needed to be stored, and needed to be communicated between client/server. I also worked to set up an empty React Native project, confirming I could build the app successfully in the development environment. We were hoping to have more of the frontend done this week, but there's still time tomorrow to get started on a calendar view.
3. This week I would like to get a skeleton of the application started in React, mainly focusing on the calendar layout and how events are displayed on the screen. I will be working with the rest of the frontend team on this.

#### James:
1. In the following week I plan on designing the database schema, and implementing the necessary rails Index and Create controller methods (based off the REST API specification). I will also work to finish the REST API specification.
2. I worked with team members on the REST API specification, and wrote the readme describing the layout of the backend. I also figured out how to implement the GET and POST responses in Ruby on Rails.
3. I plan on working with the rest of the group in the coming week to help identify how we want to represent data in our databases, given what functionality we want to implement in our application.

#### Marlena:
1.  In the coming week I will contribute to the team building of the API and I will work on the Git setup assignment. I will also start work on the database creation/queries with the backend group.
2. I attended team meetings in person and on zoom- in these meetings I participated in specifying the REST API, revising out Requirements assignment from last week for resubmission, and completing the Git assignment. We are delayed in creating the database, but will be able to plan how to get this done when we meet tomorrow. I learned about the structure of a Ruby project this week while we worked on the Git assignment.
3. In the coming week I will work on the completion of the database, and we are scheduled to design the auto-scheduling algorithm as well.

#### Thompson:
1. For next week I will work with the team to work on the REST API and start working on creating databases/queries with the backend team.
2. I helped the team define and specify the REST API. I have yet to start working on the database/backend, but should have better progress this week.
3. Next week I will hopefully have everything set up, have the database completed, and start setting up the rest of the backend (e.g. login authentication).
