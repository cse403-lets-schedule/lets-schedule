# Week 8 Status Report

## Team Report

1. 
- **frontend:** Our plan is to work with the backend to test the application and fixing bugs.
- **backend:** We will implement tests and refine backend code as needed. 

2. 
- **frontend**: We continued working on REST api request to communicate with the backend.
- **backend**: 
We did not encounter any troubles nor getting stuck at any places.

3. 
- **frontend:** Our plan is to finish up the frontend implementation for the final release.
- **backend:**: Backend is implemented into the cloud. There might be some
  changes forthcoming in the front end, which requires some minor fixes. Any
  changes that need to happen will need to be compiled and ran in a docker
  container on the Amazon EC2 server.

## Contributions of individual team members


#### Cat:
1. My plan is to work with Jacob to finish some minor stuffs in the REST api call and work with the backend team to test the application.
2. I looked into the reported bugs, but I was busy with other classes and did not make any progress.
3. My plan is to work with Jacob to finish some final frontend implementations for the final release.


#### Jacob:
1. This week I would like to work on the auto-scheduling algorithm, together with some members of the backend team.
2. I continued working on REST API calls and got the app to communicate almost all changes in state to the backend. I also worked with James on implmenting sign-in / authorization. I didn't get to the auto-scheduling algorithm but as a team we decided to implement it in the backend, rather than the frontend as originally planned.
3. I will be finalizing the link between frontend and backend, fixing up some unfinished features, and preparing the app for the final release.

#### James:
1. 
This next week I'm going to work with the rest of the back end folks to finish
the controller code implementation, as well as make sure things are robustly
tested. I am also going to collaborate with the front end to make sure that
interfacing with the front end is possible.  
2. The majority of the REST API spec has been implemented in the backend,
   including a robust test suite. I also spent some time configuring Docker and
   a Amazon EC2 instance so that the backend is now running in the cloud. At our
   project meeting on Tuesday we decided to switch the focus of the backend
   folks to the front end. After all the time I spent configuring the backend to
   run in the cloud, I spent the rest of the week trying to figure out how to
    configure out front end (which I had not looked at)
3. This week I want to start by getting user authentication implemented in the
   front end, so it is connected to our backend in the cloud. Then, I will look
   at the various features of the REST API and ensure that there is consistency
   between the front and backend implementations (such as the format which I
   came up with to filter events by time using comma separated values in a HTTP
   request query)

#### Marlena:
1. The setup for the controllers ended up changing, so I'll work to re-configure testing for the controllers.
2. I learned how to do testing for the new setup in the backend.
3. This week I'll work on the front-end auto-scheduling algorithm.

#### Thompson:
1. I will continue writing tests and implementing any other necessary features.
2. Due to the backend being nearly complete, I transitioned to helping out the frontend team and I have started setting up the environment to work on the frontend.
3. I will implement features that have yet to be implemented on the frontend once I finish setting it up.
