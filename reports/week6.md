# Week 6 Status Report

## Team Report

1. 
- **frontend:** Our plan is to continue working on building features and the auto-scheduling algorithms for the beta release.
- **backend:** We plan to write and implement specification tests, then move on
  to implementing the controller code.

2. 
- **frontend**: We worked on last pieces of the application to make it ready for the beta release. Specifically, we finsihed up the calendar view, login page, tabs navigation, and create/edit task/event.
- **backend**: 
We did not encounter any troubles nor getting stuck at any places.

3. 
- **frontend:** Our plan to implement the REST api call to communicate with the backend, and work toward improving the auto scheduling algorithm.
- **backend:**

## Contributions of individual team members


#### Cat:
1. My plan is to continue with Jacob and other members to implement features and the auto-scheduling algorithm in order to be ready for the beta release.
2. React Native is pretty new to me, so it has given me so much trouble. I mostly worked with Jacob and did some pair coding to implement different user interface for the frontend. I also worked with the group for the beta release demo. 
3. My plan is to work with Jacob to implement the REST api call to communicate with the backend and collaborate with group to work on the Implementation and Documentation assignment.


#### Jacob:
1. I would like to finish the calendar week display view, work on pulling data from the REST API, and get a basic auto-scheduler algorithm working.
2. I was able to produce a working demo of most of the screens of the app, including Edit Events/Tasks screens, the task list, and the calendar view. I also wrote a very basic auto-scheduling algorithm which can schedule a single task around existing events.
3. This week I want to clean up some of the code I wrote, since I was working very quickly to get the demo working, as well as connect the app's internal model with the REST API so it can work with the backend. There are also some features I didn't get around to implementing, like repeated events and navigating between calendar weeks, that I would like to finish.


#### James:
1. 

This next week I want to finish implementing any code relating to how our
   data models are related (i.e. foreign keys). I also want to generate tests
   from the use cases we outlined in our living document, as well as from any
   other component or design specifications. Then, I want to implement those
   unit tests. Hopefully can move on to implementing a bit of the controller
2. I successfully got the foreign key and association relations implemented. I
   did not however start working on a comprehensive test suite, as some of the
   details regarding hwo to do that have evaded me. However, I have figured out
   how to confirm implementation details through the `rails console` command
   line interface and using a chrome extension that allows for sending HTTP
   requests. I also implemented SSL encryption. 
3. It is really important that we implement some sort of user authentication in
   the next week, as all of the querying for tasks and events depends on an
   authorized user having access to only their content (even though everything
   is stored in the one server and database). This task seems difficult to
   implement so I'm going to put a lot of attention toward getting it done this
   week. Hopefully we can get some testing implemented at the same time. I am
   also going to work to make sure everyone in the backend team is aware of
   everything that I've implemented and that we are all up to speed. 


#### Marlena:
1. In the next week I will continue working with the backend crew to implement testing and controllers.
2. I worked on the slides and structure of the beta release and worker in the controllers of the backend code.
3. I will help implement more backend features and add on to the tests we have.


#### Thompson:
1. I will help the backend team work on implementing the tests and continue working on the controllers and models.
2. I wrote some of the slides for the beta release and I helped implement the index method of the UserController.
3. I will help implement anything else that still has yet to be implemented for the backend.
