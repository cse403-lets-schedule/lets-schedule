# Week 5 Status Report

## Team Report

1. Our plan is to have the backend group finish the creation of the database and queries. The frontend group will start building calendar layout and implementing http requests to retrieve the calendar data through the REST API.
2. 
- **frontend**: We worked on setting up the CI service and test-automation infrastructure. In addition, the frontend team worked on building different components for the apps. 
- **backend**: The backend team worked on generating the models, controllers,
  and defining routes based on the data design we came up with. We successfully
  got our CI service running via github workflows. Lastly, we implemented a few
  sample tests to demonstrate that each comonent was working correctly.
We did not encounter any troubles nor getting stuck at any places.
3. 
- **frontend:** Our plan is to continue working on building features and the auto-scheduling algorithms for the beta release.
- **backend:** We plan to write and implement specification tests, then move on
  to implementing the controller code.

## Contributions of individual team members

#### Cat:
1. My plan is to work with Jacob to build the calendar layout and implementing the http requests in order to retrieve the calendar data through the REST API.
2. I worked with Jacob to implement different components for the apps as well as involved a little bit in the discussion about setting up the CI service and test-automation infrastructure. I also looked into how the testing infrastructure in React-Native works. 
3. My plan is to continue with Jacob and other members to implement features and the auto-scheduling algorithm in order to be ready for the beta release.

 This next week I plan on communicating with the rest group responsible for
   backend development to design and implement the models, controllers, and
   routes. If successful we ought to be able to begin testing next week.
2. This last week was productive in that I coordinated with the rest of the
   folks working on the backend to get everyone on the same page. We generated
   the initial components and set up our testing and backend CI workflow. One
   thing that worked was I created a separate slack channel for just talking
   about backend stuff, which helped with coordinating work. 
3. This next week I want to finish implementing any code relating to how our
   data models are related (i.e. foreign keys). I also want to generate tests
   from the use cases we outlined in our living document, as well as from any
   other component or design specifications. Then, I want to implement those
   unit tests. Hopefully can move on to implementing a bit of the controller
   code.
